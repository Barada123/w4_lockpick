# Lockpick system for Exile mod

## Motivation

Currently Exile bases, safes and cars are imposible to raid propertly. With this addon I wanted to bring to Exile Mod the posibility of raiding.

## Features
- Lockpick can open a door.
- Lockpick can open a safe.
- Lockpick can open a car.
- Configurable probabilities for doors, safes and cars independently.
- Configurable lockpick time for doors, safes and cars independently.
- When used in a safe or door , a notification will be sent to the building authorized members of the territory, and a mark will appear on their map during 5 minutes.
- When used in a car, a notification will be sent to all the server and the initial location of the car will be shown for 5 minutes.
- Lockpick usages will be saved to a database table for admin tracking of its usage. (more uses in the future).

## Planed Features
- New trader that will show the name of the people that raided you for an ammount of money.
- Email sent to the players that are under attack.
